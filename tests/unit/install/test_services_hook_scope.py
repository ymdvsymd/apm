"""Services-tier regression trap for the hook ``user_scope`` dispatch (#1394).

The fix for #1394 hinges on a single line in
``apm_cli.install.services.integrate_package_primitives``:

    if _prim_name == "hooks":
        _call_kwargs["user_scope"] = scope is InstallScope.USER

``test_hook_integrator.py`` exercises ``HookIntegrator`` directly,
which proves the integrator honours ``user_scope=True/False`` but
does NOT prove the services-tier dispatch translates ``InstallScope``
to that boolean correctly.  A future refactor that swapped the
``InstallScope`` constants, dropped the kwarg, or moved hook
dispatch to a different branch would silently restore the
portability regression with no failing test.

These tests close that gap by calling
``integrate_package_primitives`` through the production boundary
with a mocked ``hook_integrator`` and asserting the dispatched
``user_scope`` kwarg matches the supplied ``InstallScope``.
