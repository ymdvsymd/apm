# Progress diagram (operator visibility contract)

Consumed by: `../SKILL.md` (architecture invariant
"Operator visibility is a contract, not a courtesy" + Phase 0..6
boundary directives).

The orchestrator MUST render this mermaid diagram to the operator
chat:

1. ONCE at the start of the run, right after Phase 0 scope is
   resolved, with EVERY phase styled `pending`.
2. AT EACH phase boundary, with the just-entered phase styled
   `active` and all earlier phases styled `done` (or `blocked` /
   `skipped` where applicable).
3. ONCE at the end of the run with every phase styled `done` (or
   `blocked` where the human-escalation queue is non-empty).

Re-print the live ground-truth table BELOW the diagram every time.
The diagram answers "where are we"; the table answers "what's the
state of each candidate".

## Color contract

Five states. Pick palette for legibility on both light and dark
terminal renderers. Stroke-width 3px on the ACTIVE node so the
operator's eye lands there first (B8 ATTENTION ANCHOR).

| state    | fill      | stroke    | stroke-width | semantics                          |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| pending  | `#f5f5f5` | `#9ca3af` | 1px          | not started yet                    |
| active   | `#dbeafe` | `#2563eb` | 3px          | currently executing (one at a time)|
| done     | `#dcfce7` | `#16a34a` | 1px          | completed cleanly                  |
| blocked  | `#fef3c7` | `#d97706` | 2px          | partial completion, human follow-up|
| skipped  | `#f3f4f6` | `#6b7280` | 1px,dasharray| no work in this phase (e.g. 0 fix) |

Labels stay ASCII printable. No emoji, no unicode arrows in node
text (the mermaid edge arrows themselves are fine - they render to
SVG / ASCII in any terminal markdown viewer).

## Diagram template

Substitute the cardinalities (`<N>`, `<L>`, `<k>`, `<m>`, `<F>`)
with the live numbers known at each phase boundary. Substitute the
`:::<state>` class on each node based on the contract above.

## When to use each state

- **Pending** -- every phase at the very first render.
- **Active** -- the phase the orchestrator is about to spawn into.
  EXACTLY ONE node should be `active` at any time. Use stroke-width
  3px so the operator's attention lands there.
- **Done** -- the phase completed and the table reflects its
  outputs. All earlier phases at each boundary render as `done`
  unless they hit a `blocked` or `skipped` state.
- **Blocked** -- a row in the table is unresolved AND the orchestrator
  declines to push it further this run (e.g. `#1326` security needs
  human escalation, `#1363` needs author repro). The phase that
  surfaced the blocker stays `done` for the overall run, but its
  status line in the live table reports the blocker count.
- **Skipped** -- the cardinality for the phase is 0 (e.g. zero rows
  routed to fix-dispatch because all LEGIT issues already have a PR
  in flight). Render with stroke-dasharray so the operator sees the
  phase ran-but-no-op.

## What to print, exactly

At each phase boundary (and once at the start, once at the end):

```
## Progress (Phase <N> - <name>)

<mermaid block from template above with current state classes>

### Live ground-truth table

<the current ground-truth-table.md rendered with all rows>
```

Both the diagram and the table go to chat output, not to plan.md.
Plan.md retains the canonical table for the orchestrator's own
re-reads at phase boundaries (B4 PLAN MEMENTO); chat output is for
the operator's situational awareness.

## Dispatch-time table requirement

When spawning a fan-out wave (Phase 1, 1.5, 3a, 3b, 4, 5b), the
orchestrator MUST also print the dispatch table BEFORE issuing the
parallel spawns, so the operator sees which subagent is doing what:

```
### Dispatch (Phase <N>) -- <k> parallel subagents

| subagent_id              | target            | role                |
|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| triage-1435              | issue #1435       | reproduce on HEAD   |
| ceo-align-1435           | issue #1435       | strategic alignment |
| resolve-conflicts-1396   | PR #1396          | rebase + resolve    |
| ...                      | ...               | ...                 |
```

This is mandatory so the operator can correlate completion
notifications back to candidates without reading the full plan.md.

## Examples

### Run start (Phase 0 just completed; 14 candidates)

`P0` is `done`. `P1` is `active`. Everything else `pending`. Cardinalities
in the labels are populated for P0 and P1 only (we don't yet know L,
k, m, F).

### After Phase 2

`P0`, `P1`, `P2` are `done`. `WAVE2` subgraph nodes are `active` (both
sub-waves spawn in parallel; treat the subgraph as one active band).
`P4` and `P5` `pending`. `L`, `k`, `m` populated; `F` still unknown
(comes from shepherd returns).

### Skipped strategic-alignment gate

When `L = 0` (zero LEGIT rows from Phase 1), render `P15` with class
`skipped` and label `Phase 1.5<br/>strategic-alignment gate<br/>L = 0 (skipped)`.
The gate had no rows to inspect; pass through to Phase 2 with
`L_prime = 0` also.

### Skipped fix wave

When `m = 0` (all LEGIT issues have community PRs in flight), render
`P3b` with class `skipped` and label `Phase 3b<br/>fix dispatch<br/>m = 0 (skipped)`.

### Skipped conflict resolution

When `C = 0` (every ready PR is MERGEABLE on first probe), render
`P5b` with class `skipped` and label `Phase 5b<br/>conflict resolution<br/>C = 0 (skipped)`.
`P5a` and `P5c` still render `done`; the gate ran, just had nothing to do.

### After Phase 4 with conflicts present

`P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `WAVE2`, `P4` all `done`. `WAVE4` subgraph: `P5a`
`done`, `P5b` `active`, `P5c` `pending`. `R` populated from
completion-wave returns; `C` populated from 5a probe (e.g.
`C = 2 of 6`).

### End of run with blockers

`P0..P6` all `done`. The table below shows N rows with `blocked` status
for the human-escalation queue. The diagram itself stays green - it
tracks phase completion, not row-level status.
