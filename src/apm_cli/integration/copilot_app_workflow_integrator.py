"""Copilot App workflow deployment integrator.

The ``copilot-app`` target is the odd one out in the integrator
family: instead of writing files to disk (``.github/prompts/``,
``.claude/``, etc.) it inserts rows into the GitHub Copilot desktop
App's SQLite ``workflows`` table -- optionally via the App's own
WebSocket IPC surface when the App is running. The two surfaces
(file-based prompts vs. App-DB workflow rows) share NOTHING except
the source artefact (``*.prompt.md`` files in ``.apm/prompts/``).

This module owns the SQLite + WS-IPC path end-to-end. ``PromptIntegrator``
keeps a trivially small dispatch branch that constructs a
``CopilotAppWorkflowIntegrator`` and forwards the call -- one grep for
``copilot-app`` in ``prompt_integrator.py`` lands on that delegation.

Design notes
------------

* Inherits from ``BaseIntegrator`` for ``find_files_by_glob`` only;
  it does NOT use ``check_collision``, ``sync_remove_files``, or any
  of the file-based collision / link-resolution machinery. The
  workflow surface has its own collision model: ``deploy_workflow``
  is an UPSERT against a namespaced primary key, and sync deletes by
  id from the lockfile.
* Imports are top-level (no lazy imports). Pulling
  ``copilot_app_db`` / ``copilot_app_project`` / ``copilot_app_ws``
  here keeps ``prompt_integrator`` lightweight without paying any
  cost in the workflow path.
* Frontmatter helpers (``_is_workflow_shape``,
  ``_parse_workflow_frontmatter``, ``Schedule``,
  ``_derive_package_owner``) live in this module too: they are
  workflow-specific shape predicates. ``prompt_integrator`` and
  ``command_integrator`` import ``_is_workflow_shape`` from here for
  the dispatch-by-shape skip on the file-based side.

        1. Detect the repo at ``project_root``. Derive a stable

           workflow rows scope to a real ``projects`` row instead of
           being orphaned at the root.
        2. If ``user_scope`` is set AND any workflow-shape prompts are
           present, emit a warn-and-proceed diagnostic: workflows run
           with CWD=~/.copilot in global mode, which is almost never
           what the user wants. We still deploy so global skills /
           commands keep working; the user can attach the row to a
           project from the App UI.
        3. If we COULD NOT detect a git repository at ``project_root``
           AND any workflow-shape prompts are present, emit a parallel
           warn-and-proceed diagnostic: workflows install with
           ``project_id=NULL`` which has the same CWD-pivot
           characteristic as ``--global``. The user can attach the row
           to a project from the App UI.
        4. Resolve the ``project_id`` ONCE: if the App is running
           (``ws_available``), try ``WsClient.create_project_from_path``
           so the project row goes through the App's own validation
           (owner/repo detection, default branch, account binding) and
           is already known to the webview. On any ``WsError`` (or if
           the App is closed) fall through to direct SQLite via
           ``resolve_or_register_project_sqlite``.
        5. Write every workflow row via direct SQLite
           (``copilot_app_db.deploy_workflow``), stamped with the
           resolved ``project_id`` and a namespaced
           ``owner/pkg/stem`` id so the lockfile stays stable across
           runs and across the WS-vs-SQLite project-resolution branch.
        6. If the project was freshly created (either branch), emit
           the one-time restart hint -- the webview's projectStore
           does not currently refresh on a new ``projects`` row.

        Workflow-shape (per ``_is_workflow_shape``) prompts deploy
        here.  Plain-shape prompts (no execution-affecting frontmatter
        keys) are a hard error at this target: the user explicitly
        opted into ``copilot-app`` for this package, and a plain
        prompt cannot possibly be a workflow.  Surfacing the mismatch
        loudly beats silently skipping the file and leaving the user
        wondering why nothing landed in the App.

        The DB module enforces ``enabled = 0`` on insert; any frontmatter
        ``enabled`` field, if present, is ignored.  This is a hard
        contract: third-party packages cannot auto-run anything on the
