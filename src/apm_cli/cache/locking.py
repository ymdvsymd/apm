"""Cross-platform shard locking and atomic landing primitives.

Provides per-shard file locks (via ``filelock``) and an atomic
stage-then-rename landing protocol that ensures cache shards are
never visible in a partially-populated state.

Atomic landing protocol
-----------------------
1. Stage content into ``<shard>.inc.<8hex>/``
2. Acquire shard ``.lock`` file (filelock)
3. Re-check final path does not exist (TOCTOU defense)
4. ``os.replace()`` staged dir -> final shard path (atomic on same FS)
5. Release lock
6. On cache init, clean up any stale ``*.inc.*`` / ``*.incomplete.*`` siblings

Design notes
------------
- One lock file per shard (not a global lock) for maximum concurrency.
- Stale incomplete dirs are cleaned up lazily on next cache access.
- On Windows, ``os.replace`` requires both paths on the same volume;
  staging into the same parent directory guarantees this.
